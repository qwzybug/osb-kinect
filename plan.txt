Stupid Tricks

Emacs + prosthetic beard: stroke the beard to engage meta-mode? Nod sagely to answer “yes” to a prompt?
Watching YouTube: raise your hand, the video pauses, you gesticulate thumbs-up or thumbs-down to control playback
Reading the NYTimes: you gesticulate as if pushing someone away to open the page in Readability
Using Mac OS X: you crane your head to the left/right to “peek” into neighboring desktop spaces
Using AIM: you write a message in semaphore code or with an Aldis lamp
Using your computer: makes you take a yoga break every 10 minutes
Start waving your hands like the sorcerer’s apprentice: the song starts playing, and your windows start dancing and multiplying
Harry Potter: “Accio <Appname>” + gesticulation to bring it to the front
Red Light/Green Light: Processing does something naughty, but only when you’re not looking.
